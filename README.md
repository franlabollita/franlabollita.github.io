Personal website
This project was not intended to show my ability with html and css. <br /> <br />
My main objective was to work with AI, mainly ChatGPT, to figure <br />
out how powerful it was at write code based on human instructions. <br />
Most of it was written by ChatGPT with my intsructions, and was later <br />
edited, linked and generally improved by me.
